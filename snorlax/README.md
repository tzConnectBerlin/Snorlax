# Snorlax - lambdas calling lambdas

This is the full thing. Multiple lambda types, lambdas calling lambdas... If you have a LOT of code, and efficiency becomes extremely important... you'll probably want this. It's notable also, that while auditing an endpoint with multiple indirections might take more legwork, but can be more readable, as in a well-designed contract, each Michelson lambda will be relatively focused and so hopefully small, and call each other by human-readable names...

So while it's absolutely monstrous, it might still be a good idea under certain circumstances. ;)
